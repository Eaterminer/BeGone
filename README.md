Be Gone is a simple mod that teleports the player to the world spawn to get out of tricky situations (Eg: Dug down into cave full of mobs, PvP, etc etc) via an expensive Teleporter item

This mod needs to be installed on the Server and Client, not just either one

Requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) for fabric or [Quilted Fabric API (QFAPI) / Quilt Standard Libraries (QSL)](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl) for quilt

# Incompatibility's
This mod should work fine with every mod, except for immersive portals
