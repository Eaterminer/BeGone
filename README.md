Be Gone is a simple mod that teleports the player to the world spawn to get out of tricky situations (Eg: Dug down into cave full of mobs, PvP, etc) via an expensive Teleporter item

This mod needs to be installed on the Server and Client

Requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) for fabric or [Quilted Fabric API (QFAPI) / Quilt Standard Libraries (QSL)](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl) for quilt

# Incompatible mods
This mod should work fine with most mods, except for immersive portals.
